2. **AI Settings Panel** - Difficulty slider (1-5) and thinking time control
3. **AI Status Indicator** - Shows when AI is thinking vs ready
4. **AI Settings Button** - Quick access to AI configuration

### **Code Changes Made:**

1. **MainWindow.h** - Added AI bot controller and related variables
2. **MainWindow.cpp** - Added AI game mode and signal connections
3. **chess_game.h** - Added `getBoardState()` method for AI integration
4. **CMakeLists.txt** - Added AI bot source files to build

### **How to Use:**

1. **Start the Application** - Run your ChessQt application
2. **Click "Play vs AI"** - This starts a game against the AI bot
3. **Configure AI** - Use the difficulty slider and thinking time controls
4. **Play Chess** - Make your moves, AI will respond automatically

### **AI Features:**

- **5 Difficulty Levels**: 1 (Very Easy) to 5 (Expert)
- **Configurable Thinking Time**: 500ms to 10 seconds
- **Visual Status**: Shows when AI is thinking
- **Smart Play**: Uses minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning

### **Game Flow:**

1. Human player makes a move
2. AI analyzes the position (shows "AI: Thinking...")
3. AI makes its move (shows "AI: Ready")
4. Repeat until game ends

### **Troubleshooting:**

If you encounter build errors:

1. **Missing Headers**: Ensure all AI bot files are in the correct directories
2. **Qt Signals**: Make sure Qt version supports the signal syntax used
3. **Include Paths**: Verify AI bot headers are accessible from main project

### **Customization:**

- **Difficulty**: Adjust `aiDifficulty` variable (1-5)
- **Thinking Time**: Modify `aiThinkingTime` (milliseconds)
- **AI Color**: Change `!isWhite` to `isWhite` to make AI play as white
- **Evaluation**: Modify piece values in `chess_ai.cpp`

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the Integration**: Build and run the application
2. **Play a Game**: Try the "Play vs AI" button
3. **Adjust Settings**: Experiment with different difficulty levels
4. **Enhance AI**: Add opening books, endgame databases, or machine learning

The AI bot is now fully integrated and ready to provide challenging chess games!
